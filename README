I made this two Scripts because i run in some troubles with my ssh connection after i urgently wipped my Iptables and after
my SSH service is crashed.

If you want to Secure your Server you can use this.

It will add 2 Cronjobs to the System what check every Minut if SSH Service is running and if SSH Ports are Open.

But I recommend to exchange port 22 for another port

git clone https://github.com/Lucksmith369/Centos_SSH_CRON
cd Centos_SSH_CRON
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
